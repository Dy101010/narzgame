<p><font size="4"><u>What is NarzWarz?</u></font></p>
<p>NarzWarz is a game concept I created back in 1994. At the time I named it World 
  Conquest. I had no web design experience at the time (just having heard of the 
  Internet) and as my life unfolded I temporarily forgot about my game (which 
  was only a few sketches, written rules and a few maps in a spiral notebook). 
  In 2002, I rediscovered (after first rerembering) my game and together with 
  a guy named Harold created the simulations you see (or can see) today on this 
  site.</p>
<p>My goal with NarzWarz is to create a game that is simple enough to be enjoyed 
  by anyone who likes games yet varied and with the potential depth to be appreciated 
  by the hardcore strategist.</p>
<p>Right now, NarzWarz exists only as a concept and a simulation and not an actual 
  playable internet game. My goal is to make it playable not only as a one player 
  game but eventually a multiplayer one.</p>
<p>I am currently seeking programming advice and assistance in breathing life 
  into NarzWarz. I am willing to compensate monetarily (and of course with the 
  fame of being a co-creator of this eventual blockbuster strategy game).</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me anytime, day or night @ <a href="mailto:manifestort@aol.com">manifestort@aol.com</a></p>
<p>Here are some links with information about the game as it is and how I imagine 
  it to be. </p>
