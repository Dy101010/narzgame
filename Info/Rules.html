<center><p>Welcome to Narz Warz!<br>
"The only wars worth fighting!"</p></center>

<p>
<b><u>Game Concept</b></u><br>
In this <b>free</b> online game, you (the player) are the leader of a nation in a world at war.  Your goal is to unite the world
under your rule by conquering all opposing leaders.  Of course, this is also the goal of each of
the A.I. controlled leaders as well.  To win you must mantain a balance between nurturing your
nation's economy and building up your military.  You can use spies to keep a watchful eye on your
neighbors to know when the timing is right to attack.
</p>

<p>Everything you see here is completely new, unrefined, mostly unorganized but very fresh.
While the game concept itself has been simmering in Narz's head for almost eight years this
site represents the first actual blossoming of this idea into reality.  You, one of this
site's inital viewers, are witness to one of the most beautiful things in life, a birth.
With time, and your ideas and suggestions this game will hopefully grow into one of the
most popular free online games ever!</p>

<p>
<u>Your Mission</u><br>
You, the player, the hero, are the leader of a small nation in a world in turmoil.  This is true world war, every leader's ambition is to conquer each and every other power in opposition... or die trying.  Your goal is simple, stomp out your enemies and unite the world under your leadership.  Good luck!</p>

<p><u>Rules : NarzWarz version 1</u><br>

NarzWarz is a turn based game.  Every game year each country gets one chance to act.  If you own more than one country you can make a different choice for each.  Your options are pretty simple and straightforward, I will explain them here :

<center><h2><u><b>Game Actions :</u></b></h2></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li><u><b>Build economy</u></b> : Each turn, each country collects taxes : their gold increases
by 20% of the economy level.  By putting gold back into your economy you increase the economy level and thus get more gold in each future year.  For each <i>two</i> units of gold you put back into the economy, the economy level rises 1 point.  The economy level maxes out at 5000.</li><br>

<li><u><b>Hire men</u></b> : To conquer the world you need solidiers.  You need gold to hire
them, the price to each recruit demands fluctuates from year to year.</li><br>

<li><u><b>Train men</u></b> : It is important to have a high skill rate or you will lose
many more soliders in battle than your opponent.  Everytime you train your skill level will rise about 5 points.</li><br>

<li><u><b>Goto war with a neighboring country</u></b> : This is how you attack and attempt to
capture a neighboring country.  When you decide to attack you will be prompted how many solidiers
you would like to bring to the battle.  If you win you capture the new country and all their
gold and your army's skill increases, and of course you get one step closer to total victory.</li><br>

<li><u><b>Move soliders to a neighboring country (that you own)</u></b> : Once you have
captured a few countries you may want to move some of your men to the front lines, this is how
you do it.</li><br>

<li><u><b>Send out a spy</u></b> :
In future versions spies will have many tasks.  In this one, they have just one, namely to spy
on the A.I. countries to see how strong or weak they are so you can determine whether or not the
time is ripe for an attack.  Spies cost 25 gold each. <u>Note</u> : This is the one command that will not end your turn, in other words you can spy on a neighbor and then move/attack etc. on the same turn..</li><br>

<center><h2><u><b>Battling :</u></b></h2></center>
All the planning and strategy of battling is done before the attack.  Once the fight is on there is no retreat.  Their is some luck involved in the fight but the nation with the higher skill will usually lose fewer men.  The larger the difference in skill the more uneven the battle.  When attacking remember, bring enough men so that after you win you will have enough troops to hold onto your new conquest.  And of course make sure you leave enough men at home as well.  Don't forget to use your spies before a battle, not only to know what kind of army you're dealing with (and how rich the nation you plan to capture is) but also to view other neighbors to make sure none of them are strong enough to attack you once the dust has settled.

<center><h2><u><b>Winning :</u></b></h2></center>
If you can capture every nation on the map, you win.  The game year in which you win is your score, as in golf lower scores are better.  Good luck!
