<p><u>The Ideas for NarzWarz</u><br>
Wow, where to begin...  I suppose I will start in childhood when I first decided I wanted to design computer/video games.  Every since I played my first games I decided that that designing them must be the ideal job.</p>

<p>
My first real game system (not counting Intelivision) was the original Nintendo Entertainment System, in my eyes the best game system yet created.  I bought it right before the Christmas of '86, I knew I wasn't getting it for Christmas so I managed to save just enough to buy it for myself.  The first game I desired to buy was The Legend of Zelda, I had heard alot about this game and was eager to get it.  Unfortunatly when I went to the game store, I discovered that it cost $50, I ended up settling for a game called Commando that cost just $20.  A few months later I purchased Zelda, I remember thinking how cool it was that it was all gold colored (as opposed to the normal gray of most Nintendo games), Zelda was my first "favorite game", many others were to follow.  With Dragon Warrior I discovered the love of Role Playing Games, DW II, III and Final Fantasy (as well as the F.F. Legend games for Game Boy) confirmed that love.
</p>

<p>
When I was eleven, I discovered Nobunaga's Ambition, I don't think this was ever a highly popular game in America but I enjoyed it.  It was a historical simulation game where you (the player) played the role of one of the warring damaiyos of fuedal Japan, it was pretty addictive and served me well on many dull school nights during 5 and 6th grade.  This game was one of the big inspirations for NarzWarz (some of the present graphics are from this game).  Of course, NarzWarz is its own game, which has, incorporated within in it that best aspects of many other of my favorites (Civ, Risk, etc.) and a flavor that is uniquely Narz.  As Bruce Lee said : "Absorb what is useful, discard what is not, add what is uniquely your own.".  That is the recipe for all great creations.
</p>

<p>
<u>The Programming Side</u><br>
I don't remember the exact year my parents first purchased a computer, an Apple IIe.  It didn't really interest me at the time, it seemed like just another piece of furniture, a fancy typewriter where you could see the words on the screen.  Over time, I become a bit more interested, my friend down the street gave me a floppy disk of games.  My favorites were Motezuma's Revenge (a seemingly unending maze game) and Taipan (a trading game where you got to buy and sell Opium and fight pirates).
</p>

<p>
It wasn't until a few years later that I actually starting playing around with programming.  Ever since I played Zelda I loved to design my own games on paper, sketching out the names and attributes of the monsters, the different levels, drawing out mazes, designing game rules.  But as for actual programming my first experience was probably around nine or ten with the BASIC language for the Apple II.  As the name suggests, you can't do too much with BASIC, but I had fun making little math games and such.  I tried to make an RPG similar to Dragon Warrior (but without graphics) but I ran into alot of erros and I realized that BASIC was just not cut out for big projects like that.  Still I remember being kinda proud, its size reached 41K and the game ran up until the second town and let you fight various monsters and go up experience levels and buy new weapons.
</p>

<p>
When I was eleven my parents bought got my a program called World Builder for my birthday.  It was an awesome little 61K program which one could use to create little adventure games ("You are in the forest, to the north is a castle, to the east is an old cabin", that type of game).  It came complete with its own graphic editor (very similar to the old Macintosh program MacPaint) and the ability to create monsters, scences, add sounds and it had its own language somewhat similar to BASIC.
</p>

<p>
I made a bunch of little games, some based on real life (with the school as the setting and my fellow students and teachers as the enemies).  It was fun.  I even made a game (with a couple friends) about sailing from Spain to India for spices, for my Social Studies class.  It was pretty primative but we got an A I think.  I also made a series called TAOJG, The Adventures of Joe Gray.
</p>

<p>
When I was fifteen my parents got a 9600bps modem and signed up for AOL, this was back in late '94 when AOL hadn't even one million users yet.  I uploaded TAOJG II & III to the AOL server just for fun, every morning waking up to check and see how many people downloaded it.
</p>

<p>
One day, after quencing my boredom playing some guy's shareware game I decided to send in the fee, just for the hell of it.  I forgot about it but three or four days later I received a letter from Illinois or Kansas and it was a letter about TAOJG II and a ten dollar bill.  I was amazed, I had never considered the possibility that someone might actual pay for my amatuerish attempt at a game.  I had put the shareware fee info in the About menu just for fun, before I'd even heard of the internet, I never expected the game to be played by more than seven or eight people.  I received two more letters from the midwest (and fifteen more dollars) later that year while away at school.
</p>

<p>
At fifteen, I designed the concept for a game which I called World Conquest (later to become NarzWarz).  It had elements of Nobunaga's Ambition, Civilization and Risk, I wrote down all the details I could think of about the way it would run, gameplay, anything I could think of.  I, of course, would have liked to actual program it but I lacked any programming skills besides BASIC & World Builder neither of which would come close to supporting a large project like the one I had come up with.
</p>

<p>
At sixteen I was sent to reform school where I was not allowed the use my computer (or any other) for two and a half years.  These were turbulent times but even admist them I managed to design a game on paper which I called, Submarine 5.  It still survives and I plan to make it into reality as soon as my skills are up to par to do it.
</p>

<p>
At eighteen I was back home, the year was 1998.  I felt hopelessly behind when it came to computers and technology.  My newest game was Civilization ('92), my comp. was the same Performa that I used before I went away.  I working as a dish washer and using my computer mostly for e-mail and once in awhile for a nostalgic game of Civ.  That summer, just after my ninteenth birthday I decided I wanted to get back into the programming game, without doing any research I signed up for the first programming course I saw, in Visual Basic and database design.  To make a long story short (I know, too late :)) the course was terrible boring, but my parents paid for it so I felt obligated (a horrible thing to feel) to atten from 9 to 5 everyday, five days a week for half the summer.
</p>

<p>
This put me off programming for awhile.  But I didn't dwell on that, the fall was coming up and I was going to college!  I was determined to make up for the "lost years" of my adolesence and I did, my first year of college was a blast.  I rarely even checked my e-mail, and didn't think much about programming or computer games.  I went back again the next year but dropped also my classes and withdrew before November.  I just didn't have the desire, patience and discipline necessary for college.  I moved into a small room in my parent's apartment in Manhattan and  spent a lonely winter there, wondering what to do with myself.
</p>

<p>
But the spring always brings new possibilities and it did again that year when I moved out on my own for the first time in my life.  I got a place in Queens and job as a bike messenger and enjoyed the summer and the city.  Months and eventually a couple years went by, life went by, I did odd jobs, didn't really think much about programming until 2002.
</p>

<p>
In April 2002 I took my first college course in a few years, Intro to HTML and WebDesign.  I enjoyed the course very much as created the template that would become Narcity.com.
</p>

<p>
Sometime in the autum of '02 I was up one night, when two creeps into three and one just doesn't feel like sleeping, and I downloaded a program called ChipmunkBasic.  It was an old BASIC emulation for Macintosh and I felt a little nostalgic and even a little productive playing with my new toy.  First thing I did was translate a program I made in original BASIC way back when I was eleven, I found I still understood everything and I finished more quickly than I expected.
</p>

<p>
A couple days later I was browsing around my old writings from when I was younger and I found my old "World Conquest folder" with all my typed scriblings about the game and a horribly primative map I made in MacPaint.  I decided to make a very, very basic simulation of what I wanted W.C. to be like using ChipmunkBasic.  It took my whole weekend (much to the dismay of my girlfriend)
but I created a working simulation where five computer players fought against each other for control of the world.  It was horribly primative but it was a step back onto the right path, the path that I stumbled on and off (mostly off) throughout my childhood and adolesence, the path of a game designer!
</p>

<p>
I played with the game for a few days and then became distracted, my life was full of stresors at the time.  But I did make a decision, that I wanted to learn to program, really program.  I put an ad on a site called Craigslist (an excellent source to meet people, exchange goods/services, whatever) asked if there was anyone in the NY area who could teach my programming.  I got a few replies, I pursued one specifically.  This is how I came in contact with my friend Harold, without whom none of this would be possible.
</p>

<p>
My first thought was to learn C++, I'd heard this was the common language among game designers, I tried in for a couple weeks but there were numerous problems.  Firstly, graphics would be hard to create and they would not be cross-platform (Mac & PC), secondly the user would have to download the program to play it, and thirdly I just didn't like C++, it was such a big language and I had to buy software to compile it.  I stopped taking the C++ lessons but kept my vision in the back of my mind.
</p>

<p>
One (or another I should say) insomniatic night I decided to search for my old chum Alex who I had been friends with back when I was 11, 12 , when I was at my height of ethusiasm for programming, before life's dissappointmens had knocked some of the coals from my engine.  We got together, chatted about this and that, girls from our old school, what we'd been up to, things.  I mentioned my game and he said, maybe I should design it for the web, he told me about of a site a mutual friend of ours (what back when) had designed.  I checked it out later, it was a drug selling game which reminded me of Taipan, he had used PHP to make it.
</p>

<p>
I put another ad on Craigslist seeking to learn PHP.  I got a couple offers, one I took up and was disappointed, "Jan. 1st, 2003 is not a realistic date to have your game working, this will take at least four months".  I learned some basics and was at a standstill yet again.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't spoken to Harold in a couple weeks but he was a good teacher before so I decided to call again and ask about web programming...  He told me JavaScript would be the best choice for now.  In the future I hope to learn some Flash and any other system or technology that will be helpful towards the game.
</p>

<p>
The rest is history (actual all of it is history but you know what I mean :)).  We started by making simple templates, then gradually make them more complex, we added leader icons and different maps and finally.... the human player!  Harold has done all of the coding for the game so far, I have been learning as the game progresses, deciding how I want to change and expand it and then tweaking the code to adjust it as necessary.
</p>

<p>
It has been difficult and at times frustrating but thus far has been very rewarding.  The main struggle is that I want to do more than I am capable of right now but that is also my driving force.  It keeps me asking questions, looking for new resorces, online and off to find my answers.  It keeps me thinking of the game, new features to add, new ways to make it more interesting.  NarzWarz is still in its infancy, the next big step after all the minor kinks are ironed out is to make the game MultiPlayer!  I have not even started to look into this yet (2/2/03) but I know I will find a way!
</p>

<p>
As I said, N.W. is only just in its infancy, the road ahead is long and wide.  I would like to use this last paragraph to thank all those who helped in the "birthing process".  Of course, I am very indebted to Harold for the time effort and coding he has put into this project.  I'd also like to thank all those who gave me advice as to the technical aspects of the game.  And lastly but not leastly I'd like to thank the members of the CivFanatics forums who encouraged me and offered me the use of their names and avatars for the game (special thanks to "Switch625" for thinking up the beautiful name NarzWarz)!  Thank you all for helping me make this possible!
