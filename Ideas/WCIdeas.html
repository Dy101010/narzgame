<U><FONT FACE="New York" SIZE=5><P>World Conquest - Ideas</P> </FONT><FONT
FACE="Times" SIZE=4> </U></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" SIZE=4><P>These of some
of the changes and ideas I've had that I need to impliment.  These ideas are
in no particular order, just brainstromed concepts really.</P> </FONT><FONT
FACE="Times" SIZE=3> </FONT><FONT FACE="New York" SIZE=3><P>Inital cost of
men : 10 gold</P> <P>gradually rising with the -2 to plus 4 range per
turn.</P>

<P>Skill would rise after training between 4-6 points.  After winning battles
would rise 5 points + 1 point for every ten men defeated (i.e. : 96 men defeat 44,
skill would rise 9 points).</P>

<P>For every two pieces of gold you give the economy rises 1 point (perhaps I
could make this harder on higher levels).  For every 5 pieces of gold your
loyalty rises 1 point.</P>

<P>I'm am trying to think of more ways in which loyalty would be important
besides to prevent rioting.  Perhaps if you had one of the top three (random
three out of top 5) lowest loyalty levels there would be a chance (25% also)
that peasants could "come down from the hills" and join your military, maybe
5-8% as many as men you had in your army... This might be tricky though,
leading intelligent players to stockpile men in their country with the
highest loyalty, I'll have to work this one out...</P>

<P>Also loyalty would effect the opponent being able to bribe your special
forces, but I won't worry about that just yet.</P>

<P>Riots could become progressively worse if they happened again and again in
the same countries, maybe...</P>

<P>I think, the riot factor would be this : the number of points lower your
loyalty is then the average, multiplied by two, that would be the amount of
rioters.  The skill level of the rioters would be the average skill level of
the world +/- 10% (between this range).</P>

<P>I don't know about this loyalty thing, I'm sure it will grow and change
and evolve as time goes on...</P> </FONT><U><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3>
</U></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" SIZE=4><P>AI attacks neighbors not only
based on which neighbor has the fewest men but also by the desirability of
the surrounding territories (high economy, etc.)</P> </FONT><FONT
FACE="Times" SIZE=4> </FONT><FONT FACE="New York" SIZE=3><P>Idea : Use
CivFanatics (and their avatars) as country leaders for test run version.</P>

<P>Also, set up the differences between "peaceful" and militaristic leaders. 
Amount of the time they give to economy / train / hire, etc.</P>

<P>Also, more factors effect what AI does.  If low on men : less than say 25%
of 1/39th (or 1 / total number of counries) then they will always hire.</P>

<U><P>Attacking rules for AI</U> : see "Coding"</P>

<P>The rate for spy services fluctuate with time, gradually going up as does
the price of men.</P>

<P>Make "home country" for leaders once captured you gain all his countries
(maybe)</P>

<P>War options every 10 rounds : flee, if defender, retreat, if attacker
(depending on loyalty some troops may defect to the other side).  When the
leader flees his remaining troops join your side.</P>

<P>Wealth tops off (maxes out) at a certain rate, say 2500, also after it
reaches 1000 it takes 4 gold instead of 2 to raise it by one point.  To get
economy past 2500 you must build a commerce center, cost is 200 gold (maybe
more).</P>

<P>When the peasants riot they take all the gold that the country would have
made for that year.</P>

<P>Huge, WC Forum, like CivFanatics, adviritisers pay for space! (and
donations readily accepted!)</P>

<P>Once the game gets more advanced &amp; sophisticated I will add A.I.
intelligence to the game, it can be a number, say from 80 to 150, and will
affact how the AI reacts to certain situations and how adaptable it is.  It
will also effect how smart the AI is with the decisions it does make, for
example an intelligent AI would not attack a country with 90% of his troops
(unless it was the last remaining country it had access
to).</P></FONT></BODY> </HTML>
