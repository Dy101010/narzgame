<p>A couple weeks ago (June 19th, '02) I had an idea for a huge multiplayer tournament with six equal
starts for six human players and one AI.  On June 30th, the toruny began, not everything went
quite according to plan (but then again it never does, does it?), there were seven human players, and
only four of them the specificied "perfect" equal start.  But nevertheless, this is going to be an
exciting fight to the death!  We will be meeting every Sunday in the early afternoon (usually between
one and three PM, check the CivFanatic thread for exact time each week).</p>

<p>I have done write-ups of each week since the beginning, included is a brief summery (from my
point of view) of how the game is going so far.  Included (excpet in Week One) is some screenshots
of the Top 5 city list and Powerchart.  Of course this gives only a limited picture of whats going
on, the top 5 cities are only five of many and the powerchart does not include many factors, such
as economic strength, wonders of the world, diplomatic alliances or wars, etc. etc.  Still, the
commentary and the screenshots offer a glispe into how the game was going during that particular
week.<br>
