Posted in the "Civ1 - General Discussions" Forum on CivFanatic.com.<P>
<P>
I'm not going to debate which is better Civ I or II. I almost never started playing II because I didn't like it at first (compared to I), now that I'm used to it I can say, in most ways, its a big improvement on the original.<P>
<P>
Still, Civ I is a beautiful game, simple yet with infinite possibilities, I first started playing at 13 (back in '92) and I was addicted like I was to no other game.<P>
<P>
Ways in which Civ is better than Civ II...<P>
<P>
(1) The Map Grid (the diamond grid is just unecessary)<P>
<P>
(2) The graphics when you speak to AI's. I loved talking to Stalin or Gandi and they'd get pissed off and them and their followers would scowl at you.<P>
<P>
(3) Caravans - its such a pain in the ass in Civ II to choose Beads, Gold, Coal, etc. Who cares, the new caravan system is needlessly complicated.<P>
<P>
(4) The AI's military intelligence... Believe it or not, I think the AI was more challanging in Civ I, when they were at war with you they were really relentless. I remember playing the Indians (on Earth) and the Russians and Zulus coming after me like mad.<P>
<P>
(5) The replay when you win! - What were they thinking when they got rid of the replay option, winning Civ II is like eating a good meal but with no desset.<P>
<P>
Ways in which Civ II is better...<P>
<P>
(1) Better Wonders - This is the main thing to me, the new Pyramids are great, Sun Tzu's war acad I like, and of course Leonardo's Workshop.<P>
<P>
(2) Military - the new units really make for a more balanced game (in Civ I, the jump from Knights to Armors was just too much), also Engineers are cool.<P>
<P>
(3) Combat - the new combat system is better than the dice throw you got with Civ I<P>
<P>
(4) Mutltiplayer - I never did get to play a Multiplayer game in Civ I, its too bad, I'm sure it would've been fun<P>
<P>
(5) The AI doesn't get "stuck" as much - Granted the AI is still pretty dumb compared to a strong human player but at least they rarely get stuck with one city like so often in Civ I (on Earth, the Romans, English amd sometimes Chinese rarely founded a 2nd city)<P>
<P>
All in all, these are both great games. I am looking forward to trying Civ III.<P>
<P>
Proudest Civ I moment... conquering the world (on Earth) as the Mongols around 1300BC (I remember I had to go all the way to Australia to wipe out the last replacement Civ). I think the difficulty level was King.<P>
<P>
Take care all!<P>
