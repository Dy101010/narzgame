<p><h2><u>Week One - June 30th, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>The first session was a bit disorganized getting started (everyone IMing each other on ICQ, I
hate ICQ) but it all got together and eventually began.  Seven players, from all over the world,
California, Ireland, Chile (I think someone said Chile, or maybe they were talking about the World
Cup or something) and even, wonder or wonders, my hometown Astoria!  What a small world!</p>

<p>Anyway, now we're at 2350BC, just getting started really, soon everyone will start putting
 their grand schemes into action, switching governments, building triemes, starting Wonders...  I'm
 looking forward to next Sunday!</p>
