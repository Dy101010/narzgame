<p><h2><u>Week Seven - August 11th, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>Five people turned out on this hot (in NY) Sunday.  NRK, GenSwartz, Migonne and myself and
FlowsLikeLava took over briefly for the Americans.  The Romans and Germans were controled by the
AI.</p>

<p>It was a quiet week on the battlefront, but I have a feeling it may be the calm before the
storm, also the two main antagonists were not present :).  The Sioux won the race to build
 Michaelangelo's
Chapel, a key wonder.  I (the Babylonians) had to be satisfied with Magellian's Expedition.  NRK
also built the Great Wall, an important and often underrated wonder, especially in a game where
expansion is key.</p>

<p>The map is filling up, according to my embassies, each Civ now has at least nine cities.  Things
are about to get real interesting.</p>

<p>Here's an alternative take on the game so far, submitted by AnarchyWrksBest :

<p><h4>Interesting Note : Not including the AI, the Americans have had, I believe, three different rulers
 and the name of the capital
city has been changed three or four different times.</h4></p>
