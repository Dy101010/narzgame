<p><h2><u>Week Five - July 28th, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>It was good to be back.  The fifth week of the tourny went almost without a glitch.  The game
started about 15 after one (PM, EST) and there was only one disconnection (followed by a quick
reconnection.  And on top
of that we had a full seven players!  Almost everyone from the beginning, Sean, Rommel, me, Anarchy,
Rick and Mignonne all showed up and PunX took over as the Americans.</p>

<p>The year is now 240AD.  Things have been peaceful so far, its a large map so everyone has had
enough space to peacefully expand up until now.  Will things remain peaceful?  Only time will tell.
Two new wonders were built, the Hanging Gardens of America (sadly not in Babylon where they belong)
and the Great Library of Germany.</p>

<p>Here are the usual screenshots of the game so far :</p>
