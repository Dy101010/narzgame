<p><h2><u>Week Ten - September 29th, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>
What a week!  It started off slow and rather peaceful.  Chief Rick built a fourth wonder, Shakespear's
Theater in the peaceful harbor city of Cedar Creek.  Little did he know that a Babylonian diplomat
readied himself for his coersive task on a small boat just a little ways out to sea...
</p>

<p>
Anarchy built a wonder too, King Richard's Crusade, always a good one to boost lagging production
as well as for building future wonders.
</p>

<p>
About midway through the session, Cedar Creek rebelled, rumor has it in response to a massave
bribe of gold, and joined the Babylonian empire.  This event severly crippled the Sioux empire,
the three citizens its great Chapel normally made happy in each city were outraged.  The
Babylonians had secured their first city on the Eastern Mainland.  To add insult to injury, the
English capitalized on the rampant disorder of the Sioux empire and snaped off a city of their
own from the Sioux coast.
</p>

<p>To his credit, Rick handled the loss well, the game will be quite a challange for him from now
on, the age of innocence is over, but he seems to be facing it bravely, which is good, he will
need to summon all of his resources to fight off the "green tide".

<p>Migonne of the Spanish meanwhile looked on with concern.  Though she had not been betrayed by
any of the current players, she couldn't help but feel some sympathy for Rick.</p>

<p>As the globe fills, tensions mount, here at the Multiplayer Tourny we are on the verge of a New
World Order!  These coming rounds will undoubtable see much action and much change.  Until then...
we wait.</P>
