<p><h2><u>Week Two and Three - July 7th and 14th, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>Week two got off to a pretty good start on the second Sunday, but once it began we had some troubles.  At least three
people got disconnected, some multiple times.  As a result we had to restart once or twice and
progress was slow.  A few people were taken over by the AI for awhile while they tried to
reconnect.  Still we made some progress and finished the session at around 900BC I believe.</p>

<p>Week three was very slow getting started.  Three players, NickM, Migonne and Sean Lindstrom
could not make it so it was just Anarchy, GenSwartz, Chief Rick and me.  Due to problems hosting
and connecting we spent a whoping 80 minutes trying to connect, I used this time to make myself some
Tortellini with tomato sauce, garlic and olive oil, I also made some choco-chip cookies.  But I'm
sure no one is too interested in that.  So anyway, when we finally connected we were only able to
play for about 40 minutes because someone, I think it was Rick, had to leave a bit early.  We finished
up at 550 B.C.</p>  

<p>GenSwartz ended up hosting and there weren't too many more problems after that, so
I figure he can host next time.  I will post the IP# of the game on the "thread" at CivFanatics
 and we'll start right away at 1pm.  Here are some screenshots of the game so far :</p>

<p>The Sioux seem to be doing the best according to the powerchart, but I got the Pyramids and
am expanding rapidly onto the continent.  All in all, everyone is doing pretty well, especially
considering some players were run by the AI for a few turns.  The game is still open and anyone
can take over for any missing player each Sunday, I hope to have at least 6 or 7 for this coming
week.</p>
