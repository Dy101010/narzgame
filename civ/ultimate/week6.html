<p><h2><u>Week Six - August 4th, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>Its a funny thing that in my week five assessment I pondered whether or not things would remain
peaceful.  Well there was a bit of turmoil during week six.  Sean was unable to make it to play
the Romans and his tribe was taken over by Flatlander Fox.  Fox allegedly broke a pact with
Mignonne, ruler of the Spanish, and she quit the game.  I had some problems with the Romans as
well but we eventually signed a cease fire.  There was one other suprising betrayal which I will
touch on more later.</p>

<p>More wonders were built and many new cities were built, the pressure created by the need for
expansion seems to be starting to take its toll.  Still, we are only at the year 580AD, the best
is yet to come!</p>

<p>Here are the usual screenshots of the game so far : </p>
