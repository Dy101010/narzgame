After over a month of conufusion, false starts and inactivity we have finally managed to gather
the core group (with the excpetion of Sean) and picked up where we left off.  Except for the
fact that my DSL decided to die at the very end, everything went smoothly and we got in
a good two and a half hours (200 years in Civ time).  It was good to be back!</p>

<p>My main order of the day was continued expansion while keeping my citizens happy.  I sniped
off a couple AI cities as well but nothing too major went down on my side of the world during these
last couple hundred years.</p>

<p>One new wonder was built, the Lighthouse, by AnarchyWrksBest.  Other than that it seemed
everyone was just reaquianting themselves with their Civs and quietly building.  Again, it was
good to have the game back in action, I hope everyone can make it next Sunday so we don't lose
any momentum.</p>

<p>Here are the usual screenshots of the game so far, the year now is now 1080 A.D. : </p>
