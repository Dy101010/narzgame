<p><h2><u>Week Four - July 21st, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>I cannot tell you too much about week four.  I was at a business conference so my tribe (the
Babylonians) was taken over by the evil AI.  The game went on without me up to the year 25BC.
I was sent the save file by GenSwartz so I could see how the AI manged my Civ and so I wouldn't
have to take up too much time figuring out how to change everything when it came to be my turn.  They
really didn't do me as badly as I had expected.  Besides abandoning my two-thirds completed wonder
and not building enough new cities they did alright.</p>

<p>We should have a new player or two taking over for some abandoned Civs this coming Sunday.
Though I'm sorry I missed it, I'm glad the game went on without me, I don't plan to miss any more!</p>  

<p>Here are some screenshots of the game so far :</p>

<p>The Sioux are still at the top of the chart but the Spanish and Babylonians are gaining fast, the
English appear to be having some growing pains but I have faith that ol' Anarchy can turn it
around.  Besides, the powerchart does not account for many things such as wonders and treasury.</p>
