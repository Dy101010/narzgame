<p><h2><u>Week Nine - September 22nd, '02</u></h2></p>

<p>
We started bright and early this Sunday (11AM), except for NRK of course (5PM).  We had the usual
crew plus a newcomer for about half an hour.  He retired early though and we decided to finish the
game with just the four of us.  One extra player = as much as five more minutes per turn = much
longer wait overall.  Besides, the four of us (NRK, Migonne, Rick {aka. GenSwartz} and I have
been down from the beginning and random new players coming and going somewhat disrupts the game.

Continued expansion was the order of the day for the Babylonian empire.  The rest of the world
caught up and surpassed me in technology but I managed to get most of what I needed though my
diplomacy skills and loyal contacts <img src="/ZDownloads/Smileys/wink.gif">

Many wonderous wonders were built in these last 110 years.  Migonne was the first to complete
J.S. Bach's Cathedral, a key wonder, saving untold amounts of luxery and temple funds.  Chief
Rick bulit Leonardo's Workshop, a time saving (and resource saving) favorite and I built the
 first modern marvel, Statue of Liberty.  Its funny, by building a structure that stands for
 liberty, one is able to form a government based on relgious Fanaticism

<p><h4>NRK had made significant progress and through zooming in on the powerchart on Photoshop it
appears he has finally surpassed the Germans.  Meanwhile, overall it seems the Babylonians have
pulled slightly ahead <img src="/ZDownloads/Smileys/biggrin.gif"></h4></p>
