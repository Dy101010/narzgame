<p>I no longer run the NMCC, all the older ones are still available however (scroll to
the bottom of the page), feel free to
download and play them.  This is the most recent one...</p>

<h2><p>Welcome to Narz's Monthly Civ Challange - November/December '02</p></h2> <p>The concept, a direct
copetition without the need for people to meet up at the same place, at the same time.  The answer,
Narz's Monthly Civ Challange.

<p></p> It is always interesting to see how others play the game.  You do not have to view this as a
competition, you can see it merely as a learning experience to see how your stratagies fare against
the stratagies of others</p>

</p><p>This will be the sixth installment of NMCC, for November/December 2002.</P>

Specs for this month<br> 7 Civilizations, King, Large Flat Map, Barbarian level = Roving Bands<br>

<p><h4>This is another semi-crippled start for the human and slight advantage for the hapless AI.
You are Napoleon of the French, banished on a tiny island with only your small but loyal city and
a single carvel.  Note, this is not a historical scenerio or an Earth like map but I figured it
was appropriate to have Napoleon as the leader of an island stranded tribe.</p>


<p>Another twist, there are three barbarian cities each with one quality wonder, Magellian's
Expidition, Michaelangelo's Chapel and Adam Smith's Trading Company.  Rather than quietly build
these wonders the played must go out and find and capture them.

<p>Due to the fact that people have lives outside of Civ (even me... well I'm working on it anyway
<img src="/ZDownloads/Smileys/wink.gif">) I have extended the amount of time you have for the game
straight through to New Year's Day 2003.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>This is the formula I use to rank the contestants.  It is basically the same as the one used by
the GOTM forum on CivFanatics, the only difference is that I include the bonus you get for
conquering or sending up a space ship.</p>

<p>I have attached a MicroSoft Excel program that you can use to calculate your own score (courtesy
of CivFanatics), to get your NMCC score simply put in your official Civ score along with the date
finished, difficulty level and map size. <a href="/ZDownloads/NMCCcalculator.xls">Download NMCC
Score Calculator (16K)</a><br> Don't sweat your score too much, just go out there and crush that
AI!</p>
