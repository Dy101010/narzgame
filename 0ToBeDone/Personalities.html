<p>Instead of the simply Case 1, 2 and 3 to detirmine what a computer controlled country
will do I want to create a new "Type" variable.  Different computer rulers will be of
different types.  The Choice variable will be between 1-100 instead of 1-3.</p>

<p>The A.I. "types" will also have differnt likelihoods of attack.  Some will wait to 
attack until they have at least double the troops of their enemy, some will attack much
more readily.

<p>Note : All A.I. rulers will behave the same in certain situations, for example they
will all continue to move troops to adjoining nations and will all automatically hire if
they have fewer than 25 men.  Also if they have no surrounding hostile nations they
will hire rather than train.</p>
