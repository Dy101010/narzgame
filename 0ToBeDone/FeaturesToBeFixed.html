<h2><b><u>Features to be fixed</h2></b></u>

<ol>

</li><br><li>Add authentication for commands (so you can't hire 8000 solidiers if you
don't have the money)

</li><br><li>Reduce size of "Your Orders Sir?" window.  
Check out <a href="NewLayout/NewLayout.html" target="blank">New Layout Look</a> (don't
worry about the map and avatars not lined up right, I just want you to observe the way
the windows are set up.  Its not perfect but it'll do for now.

</li><br><li>Make spy option not take up one turn (the player can use a spy and then choose
to attack or train or whatever), limit of one spy per turn.

</li><br><li>Spy window should include leader Avatar, spy cost is 25 Gold.

</li><br><li>When going to war, ask "how many troops?" instead of using the 65-75% forumla.

</li><br><li>If a leader has no attacks available (surrounded by friendly nations) he will never train anymore (anytime he would have trained he will now hire).

</li><br><li>Fix "Add gold to economy" option (right now it takes double the gold you put in the box) : I can probably figure out this one myself, just need to find out where the code I need to edit is.
