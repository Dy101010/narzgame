<h2><b><u>Features to Add in the Future (after game is released)</h2></b></u>

<ol>

<li>Make A.I. move to and "towards" nations that have access to an attack.  This may be a difficult formula to figure out but there must be a way!

</li><br><li>Additional feature of leader "personalities" which effect their
decisions regarding their choices each country turn and their likelihood of
going to war.  <a href="Personalities.html" target="blank">Details</a>

</li><br><li>Make sure to ask about power-graph in the forum!!!!!!!!!!! (Reminder to myself)

</li><br><li>For the Self-Play, each time it is run to completion the winner (and round that player wins) is stored somewhere outside of the page.  Database program needed.

</li><br><li>Ultimate goal is to go MultiPlayer!

</ol>

<h2><b><u>Features I am thinking about, not quite sure on yet</h2></b></u>

<li>For certain maps make "Continental Bonuses", similar to Risk, for owning all the
nations in a given continent.  We'd have to add coding to make the A.I. also "want" to
go for whole continents.
