<h2><b><u>Features to Add</h2></b></u>

<ol>

<li>Replace with "View all my Nations" button which allows the
player to quickly check the stats of all the countries he owns.  This info
should open in a new window and if possible should automatically update when
stats change (or the player gains a new country or loses a current one).

</li><br><li>New user sign-in (may need database program) which stores the
user's name and password and other optional information : question in case of
lost password, age, city and country of user.

</li><br><li>Active user log-in screen, that will check that the user's id
and password match.

</li><br><li>Active avatar choosing screen and map choosing screen (both complete HTMLwise)
where the user can choose which avatard he'd like to be represented by in the game and
which map
he would like to play on and the game will link to the appropriate map, carried with it
the user information (user name, avatar choice, etc.).

</li><br><li>A high score list page (may need database for this one too), the
high score list will automatically update whenever a player wins.  There will
be a different high score list for each map.  The H.S. list will hold the top
25 scores (the score for now is the number of rounds that the player takes to
win, the lower the better).

</li><br><li>Add a pause button that will stop the game from moving ahead (in case the
player needs to go to the bathroom and doesn't want to miss any battles between the
A.I.), when pressed again it will resume running the code (maybe the button could call
an infinite loop or something and pressing it again would break it out of the loop and
return to where the game left off).

</li><br><li>Figure out why game is incompatable with Netscape (at least my older
version) and fix the problem.

</li><br><li>Random stats for each leader (except player) except in certain scenerios (like
the Earth map).
