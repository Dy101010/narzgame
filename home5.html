<b><u>Game Concept</b></u><br>
In this <b>free</b> online game, you (the player) are the leader of a nation in a world at war.  Your goal is to unite the world
under your rule by conquering all opposing leaders.  Of course, this is also the goal of each of
the A.I. controlled leaders as well.  To win you must mantain a balance between nurturing your
nation's economy and building up your military.  You can use spies to keep a watchful eye on your
neighbors to know when the timing is right to attack.
</p>

<p>Everything you see here is completely new, unrefined, mostly unorganized but very fresh.
While the game concept itself has been simmering in Narz's head for almost eight years this
site represents the first actual blossoming of this idea into reality.  You, one of this
site's inital viewers, are witness to one of the most beautiful things in life, a birth.
With time, and your ideas and suggestions this game will hopefully grow into one of the
most popular free online games ever!</p>
