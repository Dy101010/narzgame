<p>The game Civilization, by Sid Meier, is in my opinion, by far the best computer game ever made.  I
first encountered this game when I was 13, visiting a friend on a break from boarding school.  I
remember my first impression of the game didn't leave much of an impact, but I think that may have
been just cause I wanted to go outside.  Later that night I had nothing to do so I started playing
around with the game on the off chance I'd get into it.  I did and I've been a fan of the Civilzation
series ever since.  Now my game of choice is Civ II, which I mostly play multiplayer.</p>

<p>If you already own this game (Civ II) you know what I'm talking about.  If you don't, I believe you
can buy it from Amazon.com or someplace for about nine dollars (its an older game '95, '96)</p>

<h2><a href="/fun/civ/civ1.html">Where it all began - Civilization I</a></h2><h3>Summery of the games,
some thoughts on the pros and cons between Civ I and II and and some advice in a text file I wrote
back in '94 when I first started using this lovely thing called the internet.</h3>

<h2><a href="/fun/civ/civ2.html">Civilization II downloads</a></h2><h3>Since I discovered the joy
of Civ II multiplayer (around Feb. '02) I've been creating maps to use for my MP games.  Some have equal starts, some
don't, they all work fine against games with AIs (Artifical Intelligence, i.e. : Playing the computer)
as well.  Download all my maps here.</h3>

<h2><a href="/fun/civ/NMCC.html">Narz's Monthly Civ Challange</a></h2><h3>
I got the idea for this from the GOTM (Game of the Month) forum on the CivFanatics site.  The NMCC
is basically a "pure" (99% skill) contest, in which all contestants download a saved game start
(4000BC) and play it from there, submiting one save at 1AD, one at 1000AD and one at game's end.  I
will be updating this monthly (makes sense, right?) and will display a ranking of all contestants
who participate.</h3>

<h2><a href="/fun/civ/Ultimate.html">Narz's Ultimate Civ Tourny!</a></h2><h3>
Seven players, no AI, completely unpredictable opponents, this is Civ at its best!  This link follows
the huge tourny I got going right now.

<h2><a href="/fun/civ/multi.html">Multiplayer Directory</a></h2><h3>With permission I'm going to
list the names (AOL IM handles, ICQ #'s, GamerRanger handles, whatever) of anyone who is interested
in playing any Civ II MultiPlayer.  If you're interested in joining the list, please submit your info
to me at <a href="mailto:anthonarz@rcn.com">anthonarz@rcn.com</a></h3>


<h2><a href="http://www.civfanatics.com">CivFanatics.com</a></h2><h3>
This is the best place I've found on the net for Civ players to meet, post messages, exchange
 strategies, organize multiplayer games, etc.  The game aside, this is one of the best sites on
  the internet, well laid out, well maintained, great message boards with everything from
   Civilization to jokes, sports, polls, theres over 350,000 posts on there, wow!  Its also free!
     Some of my favorite forums are... Civ II GOTM (Game of the month), Civ II Multiplayer, Off
      Topic (post anything), and Play Chess (good place for correspondence games).  Tell 'em Narz
       sent ya!

<h2><a href="http://www.gameranger.com">GameRanger.com</a></h2><h3>
I've found this to be the best place for Mac users to pick up a Civ II MultiPlayer game.
