<p><font size="4">Well for starters I would like to develop different &quot;personality 
  types&quot;. Rather than the A.I. all following the same formula (hiring 1/3, 
  training 1/3, building 1/3, X likelihood of attacking, etc.) I'd like to create 
  various personalities to make things more interesting for the player.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here is the example of how I would like the A.I. players for 
  my presented simulation to function (note : they don't currently function this 
  way, this is one of the first features I would like to add, along with the human 
  player of course.</font></p>
<p><img src="/Div.gif" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></p>
<p><u>Name</u> : Name of leader, pretty self explanatory</p>
<p><u>T%, H%, B%</u> : Each turn the AI players must take an action. If they do 
  not go to war (or transfer troops) they have the choice to either Train, Hire 
  or Build (Economy), these percentages show the likelihood of each for the given 
  player.</p>
<p><u>ASN</u> = Attack Strngth Needed. A player will only even consider attack 
  if he has this percentage of his potential victim's amount of troops.</p>
<p><u>AA</u> = Agressiveness Amount. The likelihood of attack with go up or down 
  a percentage based on this number.</p>
